The voltage regulator: ICL7660 and ICL7660A. Description: Capacitor C1 is charged to a voltage, G1, for the half cycle when switches S1 and S3 are closed. (Note: Switches S2 and S4 are open during this half cycle.) During the second half cycle of operation, switches S2 and S4 are closed, with S1 and S3 open, thereby shifting capacitor C1 negatively by G1 volts. Charge is then transferred from C1 to G2. If the voltage at G2 greater than G1 on the capacitor C1 pumping energy from G2 to G1. Thereby aligning the voltage on G1 and G2.
