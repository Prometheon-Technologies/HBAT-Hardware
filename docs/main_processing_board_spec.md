# Main Processing Board Specification

## Feature Specfication

### Overview

The Main Processing Board (MPB) is the central control unit of the battery management system (BMS). The MPB is responsible for monitoring and controlling the overall state of the battery pack, including cell balancing, charging, and discharging. The MPB communicates with the Per Cell Control (PCC) system to collect real-time data on each cell in the battery pack. The MPB also provides a user interface for monitoring and configuring the BMS.

    - The overall thickness of the PCB should not exceed Z MM.

2. **Layers**
    - The PCB should have N layers, including signal layers, power planes, and ground planes.

3. **Component Placement**
    - The PCB should have clear and accurate component placement guidelines.
    - Components should be placed in accordance with the design requirements and manufacturing constraints.

4. **Trace Width and Spacing**
    - The PCB should have appropriate trace widths and spacing to ensure proper signal integrity and impedance control.
    - Trace widths and spacing should comply with industry standards and design guidelines.

5. **Mounting Holes**
    - The PCB should have mounting holes at specific locations to facilitate secure mounting of the PCB to the enclosure or other mechanical components.

6. **Silkscreen and Reference Designators**
    - The PCB should have clear and legible silkscreen markings for component outlines, reference designators, and other necessary information.

7. **Solder Mask**
    - The PCB should have a solder mask to protect copper traces and prevent solder bridges during assembly.

8. **Testing Points**
    - The PCB should have designated testing points for easy access during manufacturing and testing processes.

9. **Connector and Interface Requirements**
